# solar-panel-default-prediction
Introduction and Data Collection

I recently worked on an interesting project where I aimed to predict when solar panels are likely to stop working. To do this, I collected data on how the panels performed in the past and looked at various factors that might affect their performance.

It was important to gather a lot of data to make accurate predictions. I wanted the model to understand real-life situations, so I made sure to collect a wide range of information about the panels.

 Data Preprocessing and Model Training

Once I had the data, I used a program called Python and a library called scikit-learn to prepare it for analysis. This involved cleaning up the data, fixing any missing information, and organizing it in a way that the computer could understand.

Next, I tried out different techniques to see which one worked best. I used algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to teach the computer how to predict when solar panels might fail. I trained several models and compared their performance to see which one was the most accurate.

Model Evaluation and Insights

To figure out how well the models were doing, I used some measurements like accuracy, precision, and recall. These helped me understand how good the models were at predicting panel failures. After carefully evaluating the models, I picked the one that performed the best to make predictions on new data.

To get a better understanding of the results, I used charts and graphs to visualize the data. This helped me see which factors were strongly related to panel failures. By looking at the patterns in the data, I gained insights into what might cause the panels to stop working.

Overall, this project taught me a lot about working with real data and building and evaluating models using computers. It also helped me get better at explaining complex ideas in a simple way. I'm excited to use these skills in a data science job where I can keep learning and make a difference.
